Just stumbled out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Last Bullet and, let me tell ya, what a ride. I'm exhausted, brain kinda fried—kinda like when you're almost home after a 15-hour flight and the flight deck decides that turbulence at two in the morning was a good idea. 

This 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮, jeez… it's like they loaded a gun with feelings and shot them straight into my eyeballs. Literally, it’s still lingering in there, twitching somewhere between my third coffee of the day and the existential dread of never having enough legroom. The main dude, can't remember his name, had eyes that just… bored into your soul. Or maybe it was just the overly dramatic lighting. Who knows.

> There was this one scene, with the sunset backdrop, and the protagonist was standing there like some tragic demigod caught on a mountain top, contemplating the fragility of life or maybe just whether they should order takeout... Riveting stuff. Seriously though, the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮’s like an art house piece that went slightly main𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮, didn’t know where to draw the line with those artsy shots.

Started off kinda slow—like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 paint dry, but by the end, I was mentally wrapped around its metaphorical finger, not unlike those blankets they give you on a plane that never seem to cover your feet... ugh. Oh, and that soundtrack. Someone should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just to listen to it. They had this cello solo that was either deeply moving or just sounding great against my caffeine-induced headache.

def unexpected_plot_twist(gunshots):
    if gunshots < 3:
        return Not enough guns
    else:
        return Full of surprises

Anyways, if you're into 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘴 that make you question your existence or at least what you're doing with your evening, I'd say 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . If you're not, just wait for the airline to add it to their inflight selection. Now, excuse me while I nurse this intrigue and some chamomile tea. Cheers.
